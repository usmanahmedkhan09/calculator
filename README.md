### docs on the solution

i have implemenmt the UI through CSS GRID i have split the UI Into two panels the board panel and button panel.
you can see the data in first pannel the top one where you can see the data like input and calculations.
the second pannel i have split it in three column in one there are scientifics buttons,
second one are numbers & third one are arthematic operators.
the logic i have implemented for calculating operations is data structure and stack i can check tha stack length if its empty i can push a number  
then again if there is a length i can calculate the top of stack then it will contacinate the values it will be creating a stack of numbers and operators when i will calculate the values of stacks i need to use Js reduce function it will create a string using stack values the i have to pass the string using eval function which execute the strings amd give me the result of the given string.

### how long did you spend creating the application

it took nearly 3 hours including all implementation,documenmtation everythiung that was defined in task.

## any assumptions made

nope

## any queries that need resolving

no ta

## what part of the application are you most proud of (if any)

i enjoyed working on this stask

## any improvements you would make

i could use scientific calculation aNd i could use animations so user will enjoy doing calculation
maybe a little bit diufferent styling of UI.

## any deviation(s) from the requirements

no not at all.
